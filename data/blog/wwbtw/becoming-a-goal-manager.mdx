Over the past few weeks, the team at <b>eras</b> has taken many great strides in understanding the needs of users. We identified 2 challenges that were most interesting to us:

- Individuals find it difficult to make (financial) plans - which we've termed 'action plans
- Individuals have difficulty following through on their plans

As we spoke to more users, with the rigorous testing framework introduced by UX expert Timothy Kryaninko, we started to uncover several facts:

- Making plans, especially with AI, is easy
- Achieving the right specificity in plans is challenging; what's specific to one person might be vague to another
- Following through on a plan has always been difficult, and goes beyond what AI can deliver

## A fork in the road

These learnings, and our own experience using the tool, made it clear that we had to make a choice. We could focus on making high-quality plans, perhaps by scraping the internet and improving the relevance of a suggestion to a user. This would be a matching problem. We'd combine a user's input, background, and message history with the most relevant and up-to-date information available on the internet.

Alternatively, we could focus on guiding users through a plan, ensuring that they feel supported when embarking on a significant goal in their life. Anecdotes from our initial conversations seemed to suggest that this was a pressing issue for people:

> I fear making a big change like a career shift on my own. I wouldn't do it without someone to walk me through it. - L

> The biggest benefit of my financial advisor is that I'm told what to do, when. He knew I was probably getting a raise and proactively told me to address this change in my tax filings. - R

> I want to constantly be reminded that I have an upcoming wedding to pay for, so that I don't lose sight of why I'm doing what I know I have to do. - P

The common element shared by these concerns is simple but challenging to address. It requires an understanding of what goals people want to achieve, how they want to accomplish it, and what motivation and information they require at different points of their journey.

## Focusing on follow through

Having delved deep into this domain, we've come to recognise 'follow through' as a compelling niche for our startup. Given our limitations (time, money, expertise), we need to work on areas that aren't being addressed by [big tech](https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/google-ai-personal-life-coach-b2395145.html). Their expertise will continue to be in connecting their vast amounts of data with an individual's needs, giving them personalised answers when they need it.

However, what happens when you begin to falter on a task that, despite your "knowledge" about what to do, remains challenging? What about the difficulty in adjusting your goals to your changing circumstances? Indeed, high-quality plans make sense as the domain for technologically superior companies. We're here to guide you on the rest of that journey.

It's going to be interesting working our way into this ecosystem of personalised planning and productivity, but based on our research, making a plan isn't the only area folks have trouble with. It makes sense for us to focus on a pain point that will come up, even when you have an incredible plan in front of you.

To wrap this up with Michelangelo's quote, we see ourselves as the block of marble, and our journey is about discovering the statue within. We're being sculpted into a business that truly connects our vision with users' needs. We could also say we see our users as blocks of marble, ready to be formed into their best selves - with the help of <b>eras</b>...!
