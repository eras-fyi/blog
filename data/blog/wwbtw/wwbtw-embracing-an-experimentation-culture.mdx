summary: Learn how we used insights from Street Grandma and Dr. Else van der Berg to embrace a culture of experimentation, overcome challenges, and progress eras.

Hello everyone! Welcome to the second installment of "What We Built This Week". Last week, Edmond discussed [improving plan quality and managing AI hallucinations](http://eras.fyi/blog/wwbtw-plan-quality). Since then, we further improved plan quality with tweaks to the AI prompt and significant additions to the content database, on which <b>eras</b>’s guidance is built. Primarily, however, we worked on embracing a culture of experimentation.

## Embracing Experimentation

I have always been hesitant to take risks when it comes to building our app. I want to create something amazing and useful right out of the gate, and the idea of producing something that I know isn't good enough—let alone asking people to use it—has always been a challenge for me. The Instagram post below from Street Grandma makes the point well: as creative, ambitious people with a vision who are just getting started, it is hard to keep producing when you know that what you're producing just isn't good enough. Fortunately, the post also provides the solution: Push. Produce. Execute.

## Learning from the Best

Street Grandma’s sentiment is echoed in an insightful and eerily-timed article by Dr. Else van der Berg, one of our former instructors from The Berlin Startup School's [Startup Academy](https://www.berlinstartupschool.com/academy). In her piece, ["Building a Culture of Experimentation"](https://elsevanderberg.substack.com/p/building-a-culture-of-experimentation), she discusses the importance and challenges of fostering an experimentation culture in tech companies. Experimentation involves taking bold, sometimes risky actions for maximum learning, often leading to failures. But these failures are not setbacks; they're opportunities for learning and growth.

## Growing with the Tests

This past week, we worked on embracing this culture of experimentation. We've focused on the needs of career changers, conducted rigorous user interviews, collected valuable feedback, and made strategic decisions quickly. Our execution was not perfect—as they say, Rome wasn’t built in a day. But the new focus on experimentation and rapid execution did yield some obvious benefits. We received ample feedback that helped us to better frame the job-to-be-done for users. We refined career changers to be “potential career changers”—many individuals who are stressed and unhappy in their current line of work stay where they are because they can’t “afford” to switch (e.g., the new career will pay less, retraining is too expensive, they don’t have savings to cover expenses while they retrain, and so on). Further, there was a noticeable improvement in my and Edmond’s communication with one another, increased creativity, and some energizing thinking about how we can monetize eras without hurting our social impact mission.

Embracing an experimentation culture is essential for the growth and success of startups, and <b>[eras](https://eras.fyi)</b> is no different. It was not an easy week, and the weeks ahead will also be tough, but it was an activating week. And it’s clear that by pushing past the fear of failure and embracing bold actions for maximum learning, we are going to build a tool that will truly help individuals overcome the financial barriers to achieving their goals.
