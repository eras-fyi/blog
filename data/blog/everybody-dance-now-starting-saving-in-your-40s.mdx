In the seventh episode of the second season of "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," Aunt Viv is in crisis! She realizes that she is "old," worried about what she hasn't done and, in particular, the dreams she's abandoned, including her dream of becoming a dancer. If you are in your 40s and do not have savings or a sense of control over your finances, I imagine you can relate. You may have given up the idea that you will ever be able to save or improve your financial habits. And retirement?! Please! But you are mistaken—don't have to win the lottery or go back in time to save the future, you just have to start.

### Why you aren't saving

If you are reading this, it’s probably because you aren’t saving or are not saving enough. I've said it before and will say it again: you are not alone. According to an [OECD survey](https://www.oecd.org/financial/education/oecd-infe-2020-international-survey-of-adult-financial-literacy.pdf), 28% of adults only have about a week's worth of expenses saved. And there are probably some misperceptions holding you back from getting started.

### It's too late to start now

You probably think that you’ve missed the boat when it comes to saving for retirement. You assume that since you didn't start in your 20s, you'll never be able to catch up. That may be true, but some is better than none. It's never too late to start saving; every little bit counts.

### You don’t make enough money to save

Another common excuse is that people believe they don't make enough money to save for retirement. But the truth is, you don't have to make a lot of money to start saving. Even small amounts of money saved consistently can add up over time.

### You’ll have to sacrifice too much to save

Some people think saving for retirement means giving up everything they love. But the reality is that you can still enjoy life while saving for the future. It's all about finding a balance and making wise choices. That being said, changing your lifestyle might be [liberating](https://g.co/kgs/QpYQff).

### You are an old dog who can’t learn new tricks

The adage, "You can't teach an old dog new tricks," might seem like it applies to retirement savings, but it couldn't be further from the truth. It's never too late to learn something new, and it's never too late to start saving. But you do have to start.

## How to start saving: set a goal

The key to beginning is to set a "[smart](https://www.clevergirlfinance.com/blog/saving-money-in-a-jar/)" goal—a goal that is specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound. While retirement is likely the biggest concern, that might not be a smart goal because it is amorphous and far away.

### Build an emergency fund

A great, motivating first goal would be to build an [emergency fund](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Emergency_fund). An emergency fund is money you set aside to cover unexpected expenses such as medical bills, car or home repairs, or job loss. It should be enough to cover at least three months' worth of expenses. With an emergency fund, you will have financial security during unexpected life events, reduced stress and anxiety about your finances, and a spring pad to strengthen your financial and personal well-being.

### Skip that coffee to go

There’s a [decent chance](https://www.driveresearch.com/market-research-company-blog/coffee-survey/) you buy coffee now and then. So, if establishing an emergency fund seems too daunting, consider this alternative first goal: buy one less coffee a week for the rest of the year. If coffee costs $4.50, cutting one a week for the rest of the year will save around $150. There has undoubtedly been a time in your life when having an extra $150 would have been helpful, especially during the holiday season.

Getting started isn't easy—I did not learn to save growing up and have had to receive those lessons the hard way. Using specific goals to save has been very helpful to me (like literally right now, when I’m relying on my emergency fund to support me as my co-founder and I build [eras](https://eras.fyi/), after being laid off with little warning at the end of last year).

## How to keep saving: make it a habit

Now that you have a goal, you might be wondering how to achieve it. Saving money and building wealth are all about consistency. If you want to see your savings grow, you need to make it a habit. To help you establish a saving habit, here are four tips based on the principles from "[Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits)": make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, and make it satisfying.

### Make it obvious

Create visual reminders, such as charts or vision boards. Or consider storing savings in a jar or envelope. This works for [budgeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrqcHOl48Oc), too!

### Make it attractive

Reward yourself at certain milestones. It may seem counterintuitive, but consider spending money on things that <em>[genuinely](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/28/here-are-5-ways-to-spend-money-that-can-actually-make-you-happier.html)</em> make you happy.

### Make it easy

Don't think, do: set up automatic withdrawals with your bank and take thinking out of the equation.

### Make it satisfying

Celebrate your successes by sharing your saving journey with your friends and community to get their support and make talking about money easier. For some inspiration, check out [@mywealthbook](https://instagram.com/mywealthbook) and [@makerealcents](https://instagram.com/makerealcents).

I'm sure I haven't told you anything you don't know. The point of this post isn't to tell you something new, but to remind you of what you already know. Just like Aunt Viv, who got her groove back by the end of the episode, you too, can get better control of your financial future and well-being. Don't let age or past mistakes hold you back. You need to set smart goals and be consistent, but mostly, you just need to start. Or, in other words: <em>"Everybody dance now!"</em>
