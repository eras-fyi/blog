The internet continues to grow at an astounding rate, immersing us in a deluge of information. Statista reports that an astounding 328 million Terabytes of data are created every day. To visualise that, imagine stacking that as 1TB hard drives in a pile - it would stand nearly 4,000 km tall. In less than 100 days, we could construct a bridge to the moon!

This ocean of data might be terrifying, and it's a challenge that's set to compound. That's why, at <b>eras</b>, we're wholeheartedly committed to help individuals navigate these murky informational waters, starting first with the overwhelming world of personal finance.

Jason and I each came to this problem from different angles. Jason was driven by a passion to tackle the inadequacy of financial literacy globally, while I've been eagerly pursuing solutions to income inequality. Our collaboration resulted in the conception of <b>eras</b> with one core question in mind: Why is it so hard to manage our finances effectively?

As we delved into this, we discovered that personal circumstances are so unique that the internet often falls short of delivering the tailor-made advice we need. Those who seek answers online often find themselves facing two choices:

- Persist and rephrase their search query again and again
- Venture into online forums, hoping for a kind stranger to guide them through their financial conundrum

Even those lucky enough to have financially savvy friends or family are often hesitant to ask, given how emotionally charged money conversations can be in many cultures.

Let's take a simple query, for example: "How can I buy a home in my city with my current income?" The response on Google offers some glimmers of hope:

- 753 million results appear - surely, the answer is here somewhere!
- IP tracking limits the results to the UK (my current country)
- Trustworthy government websites appear first - the best sources for unbiased information

However, there's a downside:

- Sifting through the information to find relevant answers is daunting
- The only targeting is based on country, while key factors like "city" and "income" are overlooked
- I need to navigate the internet's complexity when really I don't know what the "best" way to buy a house is. How do I make a budget? What type of planning do I need ahead of this big purchase? What are good or bad mortgage rates?

The process leaves me drained and tempted to turn to a housing aggregator, mortgage comparison site, or even a real estate agent. The search feels incomplete as I don't know what the full picture looks like. Surely there has to be a better way!

It's here that <b>eras</b> steps in. What if a single service could provide:

- A simple plan based on best practices across the internet tailored to your needs - like an overview of the home buying process for your city and income
- Suggested articles and videos based on your anonymised personal details
- Quizzes to test your knowledge of the content and what to do next
- A readily usable budget template to help you plan your financial future

Combining these elements allows individuals to navigate challenging problems and, over time, gain confidence in managing their finances.

Financial planning can be daunting, but it doesn't have to be difficult. With technology, we hope to alleviate the frustration, cost, and effort that individuals face when making financial plans. Let's see what plans you come up with @ https://eras.fyi!
