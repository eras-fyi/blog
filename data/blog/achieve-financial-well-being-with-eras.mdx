"Money is the root of all evil" – a saying we've all heard at some point. But what if I told you that not understanding how to manage money is this story's real villain? Hello, and welcome to our brand-new blog! I'm Jason, a software developer and former securities attorney who still finds budgeting and saving money challenging despite my education and career. My experiences with money and my efforts to strengthen my financial knowledge and habits have led me to start building <b>eras</b>, a free app designed to improve the financial literacy and increase the financial well-being of adults like you and me.

We will launch <b>eras</b> soon, and we need your input to make it as effective as possible. But first, let's talk about people and money, the importance of financial literacy, and how <b>eras</b> can help you improve your economic life. So, please grab a coffee, and let's dive right in!

## My relationship with money

Growing up in a low-income family (more on this in a future post), I was never taught how to budget, save, or otherwise handle money. In college, I severely damaged my credit by not paying bills on time—I did not want to open them and face the music. But it's not like that anxiety stopped me from spending the money!

Later, during law school, I took out an excessive amount in loans—well above what I needed and that I am <em>still</em> paying down—mainly because it was available, I wanted it, and no one advised me against it.

What is the result of my financial decisions and habits? A life controlled by money, debt, and shame (don't get me started on the months of financial torment I suffered from cascading overdraft fees when a shop owner overcharged me by a couple of dollars), a daily battle with financial decisions, and an uphill climb towards financial well-being.

### We are in this together

Although I thought I was especially terrible with money for a long time, my story is not unique. Your story and mine are probably similar, if the numbers are to be believed.

A <em>maximum score</em> in the [2020 international financial literacy survey](https://www.oecd.org/financial/education/oecd-infe-2020-international-survey-of-adult-financial-literacy.pdf) from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) meant "that an individual has acquired a basic level of understanding of financial concepts and applies some prudent principles in their financial dealings." A pretty low bar, considering the significance of money's role in our lives. Still, the average score was only 60.5%.

U.S. adults could only correctly answer about half of the questions in the [2020 TIAA Institute-GFLEC Personal Finance Index](https://gflec.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/TIAA-Institute-GFLEC_2020-P-Fin-Index_April-2020.pdf). A mere 20% scored "high," meaning they correctly answered more than 75% of the questions.

According to FINRA's [2021 National Financial Capability Study](https://finrafoundation.org/sites/finrafoundation/files/NFCS-Report-Fifth-Edition-July-2022.pdf), 47% of U.S. adults do not have at least three months' worth of emergency funds set aside and would suffer tremendously from sickness, job loss, economic downturn, or other emergencies.

These are stagging numbers that my co-founder and I aim to change, which is why we started working on <b>eras</b>.

### A word of advice: none of this is advice

Let me be clear: neither I nor my co-founder is an accountant, a financial advisor, or a financial whiz. We both have backgrounds in business, but if the 2008 financial crisis, the knock-on effects on companies from the supply chain issues due to the COVID pandemic, and the <em>current</em> banking crisis have taught us anything, it is that business experience does not necessarily make you financially literate or prevent you from making financial blunders.

But we <em>are</em> experienced technologists who know the struggle of developing good financial habits, believe we are not alone in this, and know how beneficial the right tools can be to improving one's quality of life (not to date myself, but the advent of auto-pay during college was a true game-changer!).

## What is financial literacy?

There are a few different definitions of "financial literacy." Many focus on knowledge, such as the definitions from [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-literacy.asp) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_literacy). I prefer the definition used by the OECD: "A combination of awareness, knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behavior necessary to make sound financial decisions and ultimately achieve individual financial well-being."

In other words: being financially literate means knowing how to make sound financial decisions and actually doing so, <b>so that you can enjoy your life</b>. I like the OECD's definition because it answers the question: <em>what's the point of financial literacy?</em>

### So, what's the point of financial literacy?

When you lack financial literacy, it can hurt you in many ways:

1. Difficulty managing debt and making payments on time
2. Vulnerability to financial setbacks
3. Inability to save for retirement
4. Missed life opportunities
5. Missed opportunities for investing and wealth-building
6. Increased stress and anxiety around finances and in general
7. Reduced ability to enjoy life and make choices that bring happiness

By improving your financial literacy, you can:

1. Make informed decisions about budgeting, saving, and investing
2. Reduce stress
3. Achieve a greater sense of control over your money and life
4. Build a solid foundation for your financial future, including emergencies and retirement
5. Achieve a state of financial well-being, allowing you to enjoy life more fully

### This is where eras comes in
